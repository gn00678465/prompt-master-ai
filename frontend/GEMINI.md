# Gemini Codebase Analysis: PromptMaster AI Frontend

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the PromptMaster AI frontend codebase, generated by Gemini. It is intended to help developers understand the project's architecture, key components, and core functionalities.

## 1. Project Overview

The frontend for PromptMaster AI is a modern, single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend API to optimize AI prompts. The UI is designed to be responsive and intuitive, allowing users to manage templates, view their optimization history, and interact with the core prompt optimization features.

## 2. Core Technologies

- **Framework**: **React** (v19) is used for building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
- **Build Tool**: **Vite** serves as the build tool and development server, offering a fast and lean development experience.
- **Routing**: **TanStack Router** is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views of the application.
- **Data Fetching**: **TanStack Query** (React Query) is used for managing server state, including caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates.
- **UI Components**: The UI is built using **shadcn/ui**, a collection of re-usable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** is used for utility-first styling, with custom themes and styles defined in `src/styles/app.css`.
- **State Management**: **Zustand** is used for global client-side state management, providing a simple and unopinionated way to manage state.
- **Forms**: **React Hook Form** is used for building and validating forms, integrated with Zod for schema validation.
- **Language**: **TypeScript** is used for static typing, improving code quality and developer experience.

## 3. Project Structure

The frontend code is organized within the `src/` directory:

```
src/
├── components/    # Reusable UI components (including shadcn/ui components)
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── lib/           # Utility functions
├── routes/        # Route components defined for TanStack Router
├── stores/        # Zustand store definitions
├── styles/        # Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
├── router.tsx     # Main router configuration
└── routeTree.gen.ts # Auto-generated route tree by TanStack Router
```

## 4. Key Features & Logic

### 4.1. Routing (`router.tsx`, `src/routes/`)

- The main application routes are defined in the `src/routes/` directory and configured in `router.tsx`.
- **TanStack Router** is used to create a type-safe routing system with nested layouts and route-level data loading.
- The file `routeTree.gen.ts` is automatically generated by TanStack Router to provide a type-safe representation of the route structure.

### 4.2. UI Components (`src/components/`)

- The project uses **shadcn/ui** for its component library. The configuration is found in `components.json`.
- Custom components are built on top of these UI primitives to create the application's specific features, such as the `PromptOptimizer`, `TemplateSelector`, and `ApiKeyInput`.

### 4.3. State Management (`src/stores/`)

- **Zustand** is used for managing global state, such as the user's authentication status and API key.
- Stores are defined in the `src/stores/` directory (e.g., `useAuthStore.ts`, `useAPIKeyStore.ts`).

### 4.4. Data Fetching (`src/hooks/useFetch.ts`)

- **TanStack Query** is used to manage data fetching from the backend API.
- A custom hook `useFetch` likely wraps the `ofetch` library to provide a standardized way of making API requests.

### 4.5. Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** is the primary styling solution.
- Global styles and custom CSS are located in `src/styles/app.css`.
- The `tailwind.config.js` file (or equivalent) defines the Tailwind CSS theme and plugins.

## 5. Setup and Execution

1.  **Dependencies**: Install the required Node.js packages using `pnpm install`.
2.  **Environment**: Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory based on `.env.example` to configure the backend API URL.
3.  **Run Development Server**: Execute `pnpm dev` to start the Vite development server.
4.  **Build for Production**: Run `pnpm build` to create a production-ready build of the application.
5.  **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` to check for code style issues.
